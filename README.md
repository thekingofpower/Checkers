DESCRIPTION: This program allows you to play checkers against a bot using the java terminal.

INSTRUCTIONS: To run the program, run the main method in Game.java. Make sure unicode characters display properly.

To move, enter the position of the piece you want to move (i.e. A4 or G2).

Then enter the position of the space you want to move onto.

Before you move a piece, the piece's legal moves will be marked with an "O".

Black pieces are marked with a "b" normally and a "B" if they become a king. Red pieces are marked with an "r" normally and an "R" if they become a king.

The game will notify you if you are forced to make a capture.

The bot's moves are random, but every move the bot makes is a legal move.

EXPLANATION: This program was made using a 2D array to simulate a checkerboard.

There is a class for a regular Piece and a subclass for Kings.
